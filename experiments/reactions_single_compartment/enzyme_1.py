# ## Enzyme Kinetics not employing the Michaelis-Menten simplified model
#
# #### 2 Coupled Reactions: `E + S <-> ES*`, and  `ES* -> E + P` , with real-life kinetic parameters  
#
# Two reactions being assumed negligible, and not included, are :  
# 1) the reverse direction of the 2nd reaction  
# 2) the non-catalyzed E + S <-> P reaction

# %% [markdown]
# #### Source of kinetic parameters:  page 16 of "Analysis of Enzyme Reaction Kinetics, Vol. 1", by F. Xavier Malcata, Wiley, 2023
