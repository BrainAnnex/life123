# Contributing to Life123

## Found a bug? / Specific feature request?

If you think you have come across a bug, or if you have specific feature request,
use [Github Issues](https://github.com/BrainAnnex/life123/issues).  
Please check whether someone else may have already raised something similar; it is very helpful to have related information all together.

## Want to contribute?

Life123 is designed to be a collaborative process, and contributions are most welcome!

For details, please see https://life123.science/participate

If your contribution involves software, we recommend the following process:

- Do all your work in a personal fork of the original repository
- Rebase rather than merge (it's a cleaner approach).  [Tutorial on Rebase](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request)
- Create a branch (with a useful name) for your contribution
- Include unit tests, using Pytest, if appropriate
- Abundantly comment your code.  Please always bear in mind the 2 audiences: the computer executing it; the humans understanding and maintaining it.

We can't guarantee that we'll accept pull requests, and may ask you to make some changes before they go in.  
**It's generally best to check with us first, about what you have in mind.**

Thanks in advance!  And welcome to the community!
