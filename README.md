### VERSION 5.0-beta3 in-progress


# Life123
Detailed quantitative modeling of biological systems in 1, 2 and 3D

Including diffusion, reactions, membranes and compartments.

## Fundamental Goals
1. Detailed, quantitative biological simulations, including whole prokaryotic cells (bacteria), and later eukaryotic cells
2. Deeper quantitative insight into human tissue/organ/system physiology, for the advancement of medicine
3. A very integrative approach that is ultimate conducive to body-wide insights,
   with an eye to Longevity Science
4. Explore the minimalist essence of life-like dynamical systems
5. Investigate potential paths for the emergence of life on Earth and on Exoplanets
6. A community effort bringing together biologists, system biologists, programmers, machine-learning specialists, biochemists, power-computing engineers, doctors, data scientists, graphic designers, members of the public willing to share computing resources, etc.
