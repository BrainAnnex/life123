# life123
Quantitative modeling of biological systems in 1, 2 and 3D

Including diffusion, reactions and compartments.

Currently in early Alpha.

(Upcoming website: https://life123.science)

## Fundamental Goals
1. Realistic biological simulations, for the advancement of medicine
2. A very integrative approach that is ultimate conducive to body-wide insights, 
   with an eye to Longevity Science
3. Explore the minimalist essence of life-like dynamical systems
4. Investigate potential paths for the emergence of life on Earth and on Exoplanets

## Broad Strategies
* Aim big, for a simulation scale that may be impractical now... but be in a *ready state*
for upcoming advances in computing capabilities - and in particular GPU computing, and possibly
  the upcoming Photonics Computing GPU accelerators

* A "bottom up" approach, starting with a minimalist pseudo 1D scenario, later advancing to 2D
and finally 3D

## Computing
Use NumPy, with an eye to bring in GPU computing in later iterations
